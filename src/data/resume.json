My career has evolved from full-stack .NET development through to frontend architecture and cloud platform leadership, with deep expertise across the entire software delivery lifecycle. I specialise in React, React Native, and AWS, and have architected systems serving millions of daily users at companies like Tesco, Chase UK, and Cisco. I have significant experience with identity and authentication systems, having implemented WebAuthn/Passkeys, OAuth2/OIDC flows, and MFA platforms at enterprise scale. Recently, I've been at the forefront of integrating AI-assisted development tools—including Claude and Amazon Bedrock—into engineering workflows, dramatically accelerating delivery while maintaining enterprise-grade quality and security standards.",
